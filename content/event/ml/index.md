summary: Blood Cell Classification using YOLOv5 and Mask R-CNN
abstract: "This project focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for automated blood cell classification. We leverage the power of YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to efficiently detect and classify different types of blood cells in microscopic images. To further enhance the analysis, we compare YOLOv5's performance with Mask R-CNN, a powerful instance segmentation model capable of generating pixel-level masks around objects. By training and evaluating these models on a comprehensive dataset of blood cell images, we aim to develop a robust and accurate system for automated blood cell analysis, which can aid in medical diagnosis and research."
