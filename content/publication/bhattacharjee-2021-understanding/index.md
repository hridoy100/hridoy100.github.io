abstract: "Background: Undergraduate student population is actively studied in digital mental
  health research. However, the existing literature primarily focused on students from
  developed nations, and undergraduates from developing nations remain
  understudied.
Objective: This study aims to identify the social determinants of mental health
  among undergraduate students in Bangladesh, a developing nation in South Asia.
  Our goal is to identify the broader social determinants of mental health among this
  population, study the manifestation of these determinants in their day-to-day life,
  and explore the feasibility of self-monitoring tools in helping them identify the
  specific factors or relationships that impact their mental health.
Methods: We conducted a 21-day study with 38 undergraduate students from
seven universities in Bangladesh. We conducted two semi-structured interviews:
  one pre-study and one post-study. During the 21-day study, participants used an
  Android application to self-report and self-monitor their mood after each phone
  conversation. The app prompted participants to report their mood after each phone
  conversation and provided graphs and charts so that participants could
  independently review their mood and conversation patterns.
Results: Our results show that academics, family, job and economic condition,
  romantic relationship, and religion are the major social determinants of mental
  health among undergraduate students in Bangladesh. Our app helped the
  participants pinpoint the specific issues related to these factors as participants
  could review the pattern of their moods and emotions from past conversation
  history. Although our app does not provide any explicit recommendation,
  participants took certain steps on their own to improve their mental health (e.g.,
  reduced the frequency of communication with certain persons).
Conclusions: While some of the factors (e.g., academics) were reported in prior
  studies conducted in the Global North, this paper sheds light on some new issues
  (e.g., extended family problems, religion, etc.) that are specific to the context of the
  Global South. Overall, the findings from this study would provide better insights for
  the researchers to design better solutions to help the younger population from this
  part of the world."

summary: This study investigates the social determinants of mental health among undergraduate students in Bangladesh, a developing nation. Over 21 days, 38 students from seven universities used an app to self-monitor their mood, revealing key mental health influencers like academics, family, job/economics, relationships, and religion. The app allowed participants to track mood patterns linked to specific conversations, helping them recognize and adjust behaviors affecting their mental health. Findings highlight unique factors in the Global South, providing insights for culturally tailored mental health interventions.
