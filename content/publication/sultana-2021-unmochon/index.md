abstract: Women in the global south often seek justice to their online harassment through unveiling the harassers and the screenshots of their sent harassment texts and visual contents before the relevant authorities. Nevertheless, such evidence is often challenged for their authenticity. Our survey (n=91) and interview (n=43) with Bangladeshi online gender harassment victims revealed the depth of the problem, and we set design goals to collect evidence from Facebook Messenger with ensured authenticity. Building on the ‘shame-based model’ of gender justice [12], we designed ‘Unmochon’, a tool that captures authentic evidence and shares with victims’ intended group. Our user-study (n=48) revealed that diminishing authenticity problem may still leave the victim and online gender justice entangled with mob-sentiment, hegemonic legal consciousness, and several privacy aspects. Our findings open up a new discussion on how HCI-design should address online gender justice in such a complex social setting.
